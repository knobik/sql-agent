## Why This Package?

Raw LLMs writing SQL hit a wall fast — schemas lack meaning, types are misleading, tribal knowledge is missing, and the same errors repeat endlessly. The root cause is **missing context and missing memory**.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Knowledge Base" icon="open-book">
    Curated table metadata, business rules, and query patterns give the LLM the context it needs to write accurate SQL.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Learning" icon="rocket">
    When a query fails and the agent recovers, it saves that learning. Next time, it knows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-LLM Support" icon="puzzle">
    Any provider supported by [Prism PHP](https://prismphp.com) — OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini, Mistral, xAI, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SQL Safety" icon="approve-check">
    Configurable guardrails prevent destructive operations with statement restrictions and row limits.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

```bash
composer require knobik/sql-agent
php artisan sql-agent:install
```

Then configure your LLM provider in `.env` and start asking questions:

```php
use Knobik\SqlAgent\Facades\SqlAgent;

$response = SqlAgent::run('How many users signed up this month?');
echo $response->answer;
```

See the [Installation](/sql-agent/getting-started/installation/) guide for full setup instructions.
